## Recognising individuals based on movement while playing table football
This is a 5th semester project about using machine learning to recognise people based on their movement. This is done by using accelerometer and gyroscope data which is grouped into, what 
we define as, shots, which is then 'fed' to a machine intelligence. 

The development branch contains the current working product, and is an indicator for the current progress of the project.
